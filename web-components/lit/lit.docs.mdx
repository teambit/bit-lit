### Overview

This environment provides support for creating [Lit Elements](https://lit.dev) as Bit components. Use this to create and share re-usable custom elements (a.k.a web components) which are framework agnostic and can include both UI and logic.

### Styling with lit and scss

By default lit elements only support encapsulated styling via css. This env includes config for using scss for the in-component encapsulated styling. 

The syntax for this is the same as the current syntax for adding encapsulated css styling from a separate css file:
```js
import myStyles from './my-styles.scss'; // note the scss, not css. The name of the import, here myStyles, is totally arbitrary

@customElement("simple-greeting")
export class SimpleGreeting extends LitElement {
  // ...
  static get styles() {
    return [myStyles];
  }

  // rest of component
}
```

This is implemented via the [`lit-scss-loader`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lit-scss-loader) package, which returns the compiled scss code as a string which 
is then inserted into the shadow-dom.

So if you wish to use scss in your lit elements, you'll need to add the `lit-scss-loader` to your webpack config in the consuming application - see the package's docs
for how to configure this in your webpack setup. It's an easy config so shouldn't take long to configure.

## Create a new workspace using a template

This environment comes with a built in basic workspace template for Lit components. To use it run:

```sh
bit new lit my-lit-workspace --aspect teambit.web-components/lit
```

`cd` to project directory and open `workspace.jsonc` to configure the workspace to your liking.

Create your first component:

```sh
bit create lit my-component
```

Ensure all dependencies installed:

```sh
bit install
```

Start the local dev server:

```sh
bit start
```

## Create a Lit component

This environment comes with a built in basic component template for Lit components.  
See available templates:

```sh
bit templates
```

Create a component using the Lit template:

```sh
bit create lit my-component
```

## Lit component compositions

The Lit env uses the same composition styles as the [html env](https://bit.dev/teambit/html/aspect-docs/html) - please see the composition documentation there for details.

> **Note:** [Custom Elements specification](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CustomElementRegistry/define#parameters) requires that all custom elements contain a hyphen (`-`) in the name. When using `bit create` you would use `my-person` or `x-person` rather than `person` for the component name.

## Use the Lit environment on existing Bit workspace

First get the latest version of Lit support for Bit by running this command:

```sh
bit show teambit.web-components/lit --remote
```

In your `workspace.jsonc` add the following lines, and replace `x.x.x` with the version number from the previous command.

```json title="workspace.jsonc"
{
  /**
   * Apply the Lit environment for the workspace.
   **/
  "teambit.web-components/lit@x.x.x": {},
  /**
   * Add Lit component generators to list of available component templates.
   **/
  "teambit.generator/generator": {
    "aspects": [
      "teambit.web-components/lit"
    ]
  }
  /**
   * Set locations and name patterns for components in the workspace for Bit to configure as Lit components.
   **/
  "teambit.workspace/variants": {
    "{lit/**}": {
      "teambit.web-components/lit@x.x.x": {}
    }
  },

}
```
