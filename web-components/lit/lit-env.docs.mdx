description: 'A customized extension for Lit environment.'
---

### Overview

This environment provides support for creating Lit Element Bit components. This brings the potential for creating and sharing re-usable custom elements (a.k.a web components)
which are framework agnostic and can include both UI and logic.

## Use the Lit environment

To use this environment for your components, add it to any of the `variants` in your `workspace.jsonc` file as follows:
(replace x.x.x by the latest version available. you can find it using `bit show teambit.web-components/lit --remote`)

```json title="workspace.jsonc"
{
  "teambit.workspace/variants": {
    "some/path": {
      "teambit.web-components/lit@x.x.x": {}
    }
  }
}
```

## Default Configuration and Services

Lit, like all over Environments must implement a set of Service Handlers. For each service, Lit compose a different tool and config by default.

> Lit is a composition of the Node environment with some specific modifications.

## Customize environment

All environments are extendible. You can take any pre-existing environment, and create a component to extend it. That component can then use APIs to:

- Override default configurations.
- Replace composed tools with others (for example - use Babel instead of TypeScript).
- Add new services and capabilities.
