### Overview

This environment provides support for creating [Lit Elements](https://lit.dev) as Bit components. Use this to create and share re-usable custom elements (a.k.a web components) which are framework agnostic and can include both UI and logic.

## Use the Lit environment

First get the latest version of Lit support for Bit by running this command:

```sh
bit show teambit.web-components/lit --remote
```

In your `workspace.jsonc` add the following lines, and replace `x.x.x` with the version number from the previous command.

```json title="workspace.jsonc"
{
  "teambit.web-components/lit@x.x.x": {},
  "teambit.workspace/variants": {
    "some/path": {
      "teambit.web-components/lit@x.x.x": {}
    }
  },
  "teambit.generator/generator": {
    "aspects": [
      "teambit.web-components/lit"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Creact a Lit component

This environment comes with a built in basic component template for Lit components. To use it run:

```sh
bit create lit my-component
```
